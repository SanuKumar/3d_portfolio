<i>This is the one
and only PBR World Final!</i>

3
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,729
<i>Luke Collins is young,
easy on the eyes,</i>

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,320
<i>and a magician on a bull.</i>

5
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,843
<i>But right now,
he's about to face his ultimate demon.</i>

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>He is about to ride a bull
who needs no introduction.</i>

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,409
<i>This bull has 74
consecutive buck-offs.</i>

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,804
<i>Las Vegas,
you know who I'm talking about.</i>

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,041
<i>This is Rango!</i>

10
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,569
And he is ready
to rock and roll!

11
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,401
Let go!

12
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,322
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

13
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,727
<i>Luke Collins is down.</i>

14
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,409
Hey, do you guys
know where Sophia is?

15
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,641
No, sorry.

16
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,888
Tell them
to save our seats.

17
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,321
Did you see Sophia?

18
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,481
She's in her room studying.

19
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,921
But you're not
gonna get her to go.

20
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,846
Hi, Marcia.
Thanks for not disturbing.

21
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,762
I have a present for you.

22
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,251
Wait. You were serious?

23
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,410
Do I look serious?

24
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,925
No, you look ridiculous.

25
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,923
Oh, come on, Soph.
They're so much fun.

26
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,445
I can't.
I have work to do.

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,443
It's second
semester senior year.

28
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,410
Your grades are stellar.

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,040
You already have a job
lined up in New York.

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,929
An internship.
All of the work and none of the pay.

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,451
Half the house is going.

32
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,443
I don't see myself
as a rodeo gal.

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,284
Fine. It's not the rodeo,
it's bull riding.

34
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,441
There's a difference.

35
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,120
You're missing the point.

36
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,520
Hot guys, I know.

37
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,045
No, not "hot guys."

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,601
The hottest guys
you have ever seen.

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,609
Please.

40
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,801
Fine.

41
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,801
But I'm not wearing
those cowboy boots.

42
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,606
So, this is it, huh?

43
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,331
Yeah, this is it.
"The toughest spost on dirt"!

44
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,767
Yeah,
I need a hot cowboy.

45
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,166
Whoa!

46
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,643
Oh, my God!
Whoa!

47
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,324
What was that?

48
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,647
Look at that guy
in the chute.

49
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,691
<i>Fans, we're gonna go now to
the Ridin' Dirty bucking chute...</i>

50
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,888
<i>where we have got
local hero Luke Collins</i>

51
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,325
<i>from Walkertown,
North Carolina!</i>

52
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,806
Go, Luke!

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,408
<i>He's a three-time
PBR World Finals champion.</i>

54
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,087
<i>For over a year,
an injury has sidelined him.</i>

55
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,806
<i>But he's back.</i>

56
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,850
<i>Currently ranked
52nd in the world.</i>

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,490
<i>He has a long way to go.</i>

58
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,609
You ready for this?

59
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,046
We'll see.

60
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,690
<i>And today,
he will be riding Sweet Thang.</i>

61
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,081
Let's go!

62
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,201
Yeah, go!

63
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,366
Whoo! Yeah!

64
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,123
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a champion.

65
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,601
Yeah! That's my boy!

66
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,171
I feel like I should stand!

67
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,084
<i>Luke Collins
now moves up...</i>

68
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,242
<i>to 48th in
the world standings.</i>

69
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,921
Hey!

70
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,286
Keep it.

71
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,011
Oh!

72
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,684
Work it, girl.

73
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,330
It's so big on you.
I know.

74
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,802
<i>Lay me down
by the old oak tree</i>

75
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,169
<i>Don't cut my hair
when they bury me</i>

76
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,725
<i>Light me up
and send me out to sea</i>

77
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,801
<i>One, two, three</i>

78
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,085
<i>In the backwoods company...</i>

79
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,246
Nice riding, cowboy.

80
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,651
Of course,
my grandma could have made
the eight on Sweet Thang.

81
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,560
It's good to
have you back, Luke.

82
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,803
It was getting too
easy without you.

83
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,481
Jared!

84
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,770
Hey, buddy.
I'll be right back.

85
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,887
Hey, Larry.

86
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,964
Good to see you.
Good to see you here.

87
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,804
Luke, hey, man.
How are you doing?

88
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,007
Congratulations, man.

89
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,809
I know it feels good to get a
win under your belt, doesn't it?

90
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,921
Sure does.
Yeah.

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,843
Let me ask you.
You need to come visit us.

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,002
I wanna introduce you
to some good folks from PBR.

93
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,241
Important folk.
Come get a beer.

94
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,925
You got it.
I'll be right behind you.

95
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,809
Yes. Okay.

96
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,241
Hey, um...

97
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,250
You had a good night.

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,923
But it's a long
way back to the top.

99
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,171
I got a hat just like that.

100
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,441
Yeah. Sorry.

101
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,490
No, you hold on to it.
Looks better on you.

102
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,207
Like this?

103
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,720
May I?

104
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,880
Sure.

105
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,088
Uh-huh.

106
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,090
Yeah.
Okay.

107
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,966
Beautiful.

108
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,127
Luke.

109
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,201
Sophia.

110
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,965
Nice to meet you, Sophia.

111
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,209
I'm gonna... Can I...
Can I get you a drink?

112
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,489
You were the big
winner tonight, right?

113
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,683
I think I should be the one
buying you a beer.

114
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,161
Oh, no.
Doesn't work like
that where I'm from.

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,729
Okay.

116
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,121
You're buying.

117
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,567
Sophia!

118
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,165
Hi! Whoa.
There you are.

119
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,005
I've been looking
all over for you.

120
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,685
Um, this is Marcia.
She's my...

121
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,281
Sister.

122
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,850
Sorority sister.

123
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,842
BFFs, if we're
speaking technically.

124
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,806
You are gorgeous.

125
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,690
Time to put you in a cab.
What?

126
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,241
I just need everything
to stop spinning for a sec.

127
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,001
I'm gonna be sick.

128
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,010
What?
I think I'm gonna be sick.

129
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,571
How sure?
High 90s.

130
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,211
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa!

131
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,530
Yeah. We got her.

132
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,721
Okay.

133
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,326
I should take her home.

134
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,404
Yeah. Probably a good idea.

135
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,521
I would say that
I'd call you...

136
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,886
but I have a feeling,
where you come from...

137
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,883
it just doesn't
work like that.

138
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,845
That's right.

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,684
I'll call you?

140
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,721
You're telling me
that he has called you,

141
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,245
and you haven't called him back?

142
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm moving to New York
in two months.
What's the point?

143
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,565
What's the point?

144
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,007
Have you gotten
a good look at him?

145
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,323
Those shoulders, those eyes.
That's the point.

146
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,401
Okay, look.
I am starting a new
chapter of my life.

147
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,324
I do not need
any distractions.

148
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,400
Sophia,
you are literally the only girl I know...

149
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,488
who wouldn't have
a fling with a cowboy.

150
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,731
Okay.

151
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,609
Straight to voice-mail.

152
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,250
Straight to voice-mail.

153
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,487
<i>Hello?</i>

154
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,483
Hey, Luke. It's Sophia.

155
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,041
<i>I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to hang out sometime...</i>

156
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,924
<i>or grab coffee
or something.</i>

157
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,929
No, I'm okay.

158
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,526
Okay.

159
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,128
Uh, well, I guess I should
just let you go, then.

160
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,331
I'm just messing
with you, Sophia.

161
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,401
How about dinner?

162
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,322
You mean, like a date?

163
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,370
Yeah, like a date.

164
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,325
Wow!

165
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,881
Most guys, they just say,
"What are you doing later?"

166
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,281
Or they text late at night,
"Hey, come over."

167
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,927
Yeah, well,
call me old-school.

168
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,730
<i>Should I meet you somewhere?</i>

169
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,723
<i>No. I'll pick you
up at your place.</i>

170
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,450
<i>Does 6:00 work for you?</i>

171
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,806
Okay.

172
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,927
<i>I feel a sin comin' on</i>

173
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,564
<i>Please Jesus don't
hold me back</i>

174
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,324
<i>I know it ain't mine
but I want it so bad</i>

175
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,449
<i>The smoke in the whiskey's
got me feeling easy</i>

176
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,844
<i>And after I'll fade
in the glass</i>

177
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,566
<i>And you can see it</i>

178
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,041
<i>All over my face</i>

179
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,121
Ladies.

180
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,646
<i>Sweet temptation</i>

181
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,643
<i>All over the place</i>

182
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,690
<i>Give me tall dark
and handsome</i>

183
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,525
<i>Mix it up with
something strong</i>

184
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,771
<i>I feel a sin comin' on</i>

185
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,041
Hi.

186
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,690
Hi.
I know you.

187
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,604
Marcia, right?
Mmm-hmm.

188
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,444
The last time
I saw you...

189
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,443
you were a little blurry.

190
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,681
Yeah.

191
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,803
You can come in.
Thank you.

192
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,043
She's upstairs getting ready.

193
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,205
Hi.

194
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,247
Hi.

195
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,727
Hi.

196
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,407
Um...

197
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,801
Thank you.

198
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,241
So sweet.

199
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,682
He's even
bought her flowers.

200
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,601
Shall we?

201
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,801
Yeah.

202
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,691
- Good night, ladies.
- Good night, you guys.

203
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,803
Oh, my God!

204
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,371
I want a cowboy!

205
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,329
He is so hot!

206
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,842
You never said you lived
in a sorority house.

207
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,201
Uh... Yeah, well,
it's the cheapest rent on campus.

208
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,725
Is it like
I would imagine?

209
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,288
How would you imagine?

210
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,921
Eh...

211
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,089
Pillow fights in your underwear.

212
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,890
No. Come on!

213
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,400
We don't wear underwear.

214
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,641
I got you, a little.
Uh-huh. You did.

215
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,002
Okay. So where are we going?

216
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,721
That's a surprise.

217
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,849
It's breathtaking.

218
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,566
Yeah.

219
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,444
Well, aren't you
full of surprises?

220
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,847
I can't believe
you made dinner for me.

221
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,490
Well, Amy made dinner.

222
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,168
Who is Amy?
Smokin' Amy's.

223
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,122
Best barbecue
in North Carolina.

224
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,767
I kind of got into that and classical,
which is so strange.

225
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,241
I know. It's weird.
It's totally like...

226
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,647
How did a girl from Rutherford,
New Jersey end up

227
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,960
in the middle
of North Carolina?

228
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,208
Yeah,
something like that.

229
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,369
I ended up getting
a scholarship down here,
so I couldn't pass it up.

230
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,609
Scholarship?
Pretty fancy.

231
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,366
I kind of knew that
tips from my dad's diner...

232
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,841
weren't really going to cut it.

233
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,004
I just...

234
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,447
I love art.

235
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,648
I love everything about it.
I love studying it.

236
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,842
I love the culture
that it brings...

237
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,480
and the whole
human experience...

238
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,648
just all wrapped up into one.

239
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,203
Anger, sadness...

240
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,601
love, passion,
acceptance...

241
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,603
history.

242
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,369
Never mind. I don't know.
What about you?

243
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,960
Tell me about you.
What's your story?

244
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,924
No, mine's, uh...

245
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,889
Mine's pretty simple.

246
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,361
Just keep winning events.

247
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,921
Make it to the top 35.

248
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,726
Go to Vegas.
Make it to the finals.

249
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,567
I got some
making up to do.

250
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,246
I got hurt last year.

251
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,569
What do you mean
you got hurt?

252
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,967
All bull riders get hurt.

253
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,006
It's not "if."

254
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,243
It's "when."

255
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,011
And how bad.

256
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,170
How bad was yours?
Serious?

257
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,769
I've got a few
more years to ride...

258
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,327
before I'm just
a washed-up bull rider.

259
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,530
I'm going to be the best.

260
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,926
It's just all about winning?

261
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,320
No, it's not all
about winning.

262
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,323
Well, not entirely.

263
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,166
I've got a family ranch.

264
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,004
It's been a tough couple years.

265
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,881
My mom is kind of
all on her own.

266
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,047
I just gotta
keep making money.

267
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,841
Mmm.

268
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,161
Are you cold?
You're cold.

269
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,841
A little.

270
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,446
Where are you going?

271
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,448
What do they call
this nail polish color?

272
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,886
This would be "clear."

273
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,008
Clear.
Yeah.

274
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,089
Right. Clear.
That makes sense.

275
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,966
It's good.

276
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,202
You are pretty smooth
for a country boy.

277
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,361
Me?

278
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,521
Yeah, you.

279
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,724
Come on, I saw the way
those girls stared at you.

280
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,884
You think
I'm that type of guy?

281
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,881
No.

282
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,044
No one has ever done
anything like this for me before.

283
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,651
So, uh, do you like
North Carolina?

284
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,964
Yeah, I do.

285
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,330
It's beautiful.
Yeah.

286
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,841
Um...

287
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,483
I'm actually moving to New York
at the end of next month.

288
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,607
I got this job.

289
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,924
Well, it's an internship,
actually.

290
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,765
But it's a pretty big deal.
It's at a gallery in Manhattan.

291
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,531
Okay.

292
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,041
Uh...

293
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,770
That's why it took me so long
to call you back.

294
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,685
I just didn't think that
this would even be a good idea.

295
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,684
I'm glad you did.

296
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,690
Yeah?
Yeah.

297
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,122
This is just bad timing.

298
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,481
Yeah.

299
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,809
Oh, I probably
should take you home.

300
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,361
Gonna rain.

301
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,643
Did you see that?
What?

302
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,481
Luke!

303
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,684
What is it?

304
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,289
Call 911!

305
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,641
Hey! Wake up!

306
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,881
Is he alive?

307
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,371
Here, hold this.

308
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,201
Box.

309
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,687
Box.

310
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,330
What did he say? "Box"?

311
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,887
I think you just
saved that guy's life.

312
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,530
We both did.

313
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,409
Oh, come on,
I held the flashlight.

314
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,722
You were amazing.

315
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,562
I just hope
that he's okay.

316
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,922
I'll take you home.

317
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,529
I think I'm going
to stay.

318
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,721
Really?

319
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,570
Yeah, at least until he gets
out of the emergency room.

320
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,405
Then I'll wait with you.

321
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,405
No, it's fine.

322
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,681
Really.

323
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,761
And thank you for tonight.

324
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,041
Yeah, it was a...

325
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,043
it was a great night.

326
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Kind of.

327
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,045
Good luck with
everything in New York.

328
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,685
Mmm-hmm.

329
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,491
"April 10th, 1940.

330

You are the new family
the Rabbi has told us about.

336
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,801
From Vienna?

337
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,367
Uh, yes.

338
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,891
I am Hannah...

339
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,281
and this is my daughter,
Ruth.

340
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,720
Nice to meet you.

341
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,644
I'm Sarah...

342
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,849
and this is my son, Ira.

343
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,846
Ira?

344
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,526
Ira?

345
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,243
- Good <i>Shabbes.</i>
- Good <i>Shabbes.</i>

346
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,320
Good <i>Shabbes.</i>

347
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,761
Good <i>Sha...</i>

348

<i>The following
days were consumed...</i>

349
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,930
<i>with plotting ways in which
I could talk to you...</i>

350
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,448
<i>now that you had found
a home in my small community.</i>

351
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,126
<i>But I wasn't the only
one seeking your attention.</i>

352
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,487
<i>This would take
some more time.</i>

353
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,920
He's awake,
if you'd like to see him.

354
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,567
You have to eat something,
Mr. Levinson.

355
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,480
It's the only way you're
going to get better.

356
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,647
I'm old.

357
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,450
I've had a heart attack...

358
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,011
a hip replacement...

359
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,650
Surgery in both knees.

360
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,482
How much better
am I going to get?

361
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,127
Who are you?

362
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,527
I, uh...
I came to drop this off.

363
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,801
How'd you get that?

364
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,081
From your car.

365
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,368
You asked me
to get it for you.

366
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,165
Oh, you...

367
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,771
You pulled me out?

368
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,849
No, my friend Luke
pulled you out...

369
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,287
but you asked me to
go back and get this box.

370
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,600
You don't remember?

371
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,046
Hmm.

372
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,127
Well, thank you.

373
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,681
Very much.

374
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,682
He seems to like you,
which is a first for him.

375
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,731
See if you can get him
to eat something,
would you?

376
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,361
She has the coldest hands
I've ever felt.

377
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,009
I think she soaks
them in ice water...

378
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,889
before she comes by.

379
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,402
You really
should eat something.

380
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,005
I'm done.

381
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,562
Is that what
Ruth would want?

382
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,888
How do you know about Ruth?

383
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,246
Did you read my letters?

384
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,084
What do you care?

385
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,890
You're done.

386
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,562
They're beautiful.

387
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,081
She was a beautiful woman.

388
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,442
In every way.

389
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,045
I can see why they
were so precious to you.

390
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,883
I haven't been able
to read them for years.

391
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,646
Even with my glasses.

392
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,928
Do you want me
to read them to you?

393
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,804
But you have to eat first.

394
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,605
"May 25th, 1940.

395
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,330
"For the first
time in my life...

396
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,321
"I was hoping the service at the
synagogue would be longer."

397
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,125
Excuse me.

398
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,883
Are you ever
going to talk to me?

399
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,206
Excuse me?

400
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,886
I always see you there,
lurking around.

401
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,041
I don't lurk.

402
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,168
You do lurk.

403
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,722
But then you never talk to me.
Am I so frightening?

404
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,961
No, I...

405
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,886
What you did to that poor
rose was unforgiveable.

406
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,006
You saw that?

407
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,564
Don't be embarrassed.
It was a lovely gesture.

408
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,051
Ruthie?

409
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,162
Want to walk me home?

410
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,127
Oh...

411
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,486
What about David Stein?

412
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,682
He can walk my mother home.

413
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,249
Vienna is beautiful
and so cultured.

414
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,607
It has more
artists than Paris.

415
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,166
At least it did
before the war.

416
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,602
It must have been
hard for you to leave.

417
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,046
Yeah.

418
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,087
Especially for my parents.

419
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,851
But it would have been worse
if we had stayed.

420
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,763
Everyone thought
we were being foolish...

421
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,770
that my father
was overreacting.

422
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,883
Now we can't even contact
our relatives anymore.

423
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,601
Sometimes I think...

424
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,688
what right do I have
to be happy

425
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,802
when there's so much
suffering in the world?

426
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,770
I guess you could say,
what right do you have to be unhappy?

427
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,121
True.

428
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,284
For a country pumpkin,
you're quite philosophical.

429
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,925
What?

430
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,526
It's a "country bumpkin"
not a "country pumpkin."

431
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,446
What?

432
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,121
I think I prefer
the way you said it.

433
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,647
Well.

434
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,327
Thank you
for walking me home.

435
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,130
Oh, you're welcome.

436
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,850
It was a pleasure.

437
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,761
Ruth...

438
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,130
Do you want to go
out with me sometime?

439
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,684
I'm free after Shabbat.

440
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,411
Wait. You want
to go out tonight?

441
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,211
We're not getting
any younger, Levinson.

442
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,688
You can wait there
if you want.

443
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,000
"Forever yours...

444
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,686
"Ira."

445
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,164
You want me to
read you another one?

446
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,006
Mmm.

447
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,162
But...

448
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,851
Could you maybe...

449
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,363
Could you maybe come back?

450
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,322
Carolina Thunder's
a good draw.

451
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,001
Sure you can handle him?

452
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,289
<i>Savannah, Georgia fans,
put your hands together..</i>

453
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,161
<i>For the one,
the only, Rango!</i>

454
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,329
<i>We will move our attention down
to the Cooper Tires bucking chute...</i>

455
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,768
<i>where Evan Matthews from Summerville,
Georgia is set to go.</i>

456
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,201
<i>He is about to face a bull
that needs no introduction.</i>

457
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,362
<i>85 consecutive buck-offs...</i>

458
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,564
<i>He is going
for the Gold Buckle.</i>

459
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,006
That looks familiar.

460
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,605
<i>Let's go
to Luke Collins.</i>

461
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,605
<i>If he makes a qualified ride
on Carolina Thunder...</i>

462
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,880
<i>he will crack the top 35 and
punch his ticket to Vegas!</i>

463
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,161
Let's go!

464
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,368
<i>He comes down too early</i>

465
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,930
<i>in a costly mistake.</i>

466
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,280
<i>A mistake that could cost
him a trip to the World Finals...</i>

467
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,647
<i>and ultimately,
a World Title.</i>

468
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,928
<i>You really gotta wonder...</i>

469
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,844
<i>where this guy
is mentally right now.</i>

470
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,082
<i>The incident with
Rango before he rode...</i>

471
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,446
Good ride, Luke.

472
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,840
<i>...has affected
his mental focus.</i>

473
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,130
Damn it!

474
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,887
<i>What I've got
I don't want</i>

475
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,970
<i>All it does is hover
and taunt</i>

476
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,529
<i>Reminding me
what I used to be</i>

477
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,080
<i>What I may never be again</i>

478
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,930
<i>Learn it all again tomorrow</i>

479
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,130
<i>Learn it all again tomorrow</i>

481
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,764
Return of
the conquering hero.

482
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,364
Hey, Mom.

483
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,363
You want eggs?
No.

484
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,726
So, how did it go?

485
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,888
Well, you left the ring
on your own two feet.

486
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,486
So, it's a victory for me.

487
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,360
When are you gonna
stop the bull riding, Luke?

488
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,122
Mom, I told you, I can't.

489
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,971
Really? So you forgot
about your head injury?

490
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,041
I'm a grown man.

491
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,129
I just want you to get
to be an old man.

492
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,600
Thanks.

493
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,284
You're scaring
the hell out of me, Luke.

494
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,888
Please just give it up.
Don't worry.

495
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,007
So, what's going on?

496
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,485
Nothing.

497
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,881
Nothing.

498
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,761
I met a girl.

499
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,123
You meet girls all the time.
No.

500
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,171
This one's different.

501
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,211
I can't stop
thinking about her.

502
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,205
So?

503
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,806
She moves to New York
in two months.

504
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,566
So, I guess
that's that, right?

505
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,970
You soak
your hand in ice water.

506
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,400
I do no such thing.

507
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,486
I'm the only person at
the hospital who still talks to you.

508
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,561
Am I interrupting?

509
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,083
I was just about
to strangle him! But...

510
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,651
Strangle me before dinner...

511
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,560
so I don't have to eat
another hospital meal.

512
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,966
The sooner the better.

513
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,481
Enjoy his letters.

514
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,167
You look good.

515
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,727
Shall we?

516
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,281
Yeah.

517
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,530
"July 12th, 1941
Oh.

518
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,968
That was a good day.

519
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,082
"Dearest Ruth,
the memories of our adventure...

520
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,282
"are always
dancing in my mind."

521
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,687
<i>Seems like yesterday...</i>

522
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,605
<i>you helped me see the world
in a whole different way.</i>

523
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,761
I don't know why
you insist we get

524
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,365
all dressed up
just to go to a movie.

525
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,841
In Vienna,
everyone always dresses up.

526
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,401
Even just to stroll
in the park. It's elegant.

527
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,210
It is also July
in North Carolina.

528
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,648
Oh, let me show you something.
I have to show you something!

529
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,801
What?

530
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,002
Ruth, we're going to be late.

531
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,727
It's by an artist
in Black Mountain.

532
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,928
What's Black Mountain?
It's an arts college.

533
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,686
A whole movement,
right here in North Carolina.

534
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,881
And isn't it wonderful?

535
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,002
Such a personal landscape.

536
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,285
It's so direct and frank.

537
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,881
Simplified and distorted.

538
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,361
All at the same time.

539
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,290
Don't you love it?

540
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,122
I love how much
you love it.

541
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,441
Come on.

542
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,047
What? No, no, no.

543
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,681
Excuse me.

544
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,691
All right.
You want to dance?
Let's dance.

545
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,326
Oh!

546
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,491
Wow.

547
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,803
Whoo!

548
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,003
<i>That kiss,
our first kiss...</i>

549
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,488
<i>it was a promise
of everything to come.</i>

550
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,248
<i>The days became months.</i>

551
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,290
<i>We ventured on
weekends to new places.</i>

552
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,245
<i>Never once had I been
on vacation.</i>

553
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,680
<i>Had I, though...</i>

554
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,367
<i>it could never have been
as memorable as these.</i>

555
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,447
What?

556
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,203
It's the first time North Carolina
has felt like home.

557
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,604
But yet,
with my most important student...

558
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,728
I am a total failure.

559
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,848
Ruth has fallen in love
with contemporary art.

560
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,606
Father thinks that art stopped
with Matisse and Picasso.

561
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,923
I don't think it stopped.
But it's taken a long nap.

562
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,208
You try and raise
your children right, Ira...

563
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,569
and they grow up
and think for themselves.

564
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,960
Very good. Very good.

565
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,326
It's tragedy!

566
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,321
It was nice seeing you talk like that.

567
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,962
Nothing would make me happier
than a lifetime of days like this.

568
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,729
Hey, Ruth. I need to ask
you something.

569
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,370
Wait.

570
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,043
I want a big family.
A really big family.

571
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,364
I've always wanted one
since I was a little girl.

572
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,447
With everything
that's going on now...

573
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,488
I feel this need,
this responsibility,

574
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,682
to bring life back
into the world.

575
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,129
Sounds perfect.

576
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,407
You can ask me now.

577
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,841
Ruth...

578
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,968
I know I'm not a rich man.

579
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,600
Don't know
the last thing about art.

580
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,491
All I can do is promise
to love you...

581
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,600
every second of every day
for the rest of my life.

582
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,371
Really?

583
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,321
Will you marry me?

584
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,207
Yes!

585
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,569
Yes, yes, yes!
What took you so long?

586
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,286
Welcome to the family.

587
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,884
Thank you.
So good to have you.

588
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,843
"With love, Ira."

589
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,326
I'll come back tomorrow.

590
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,883
<i>I'm gonna
set aside my pride</i>

591
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,121
<i>Not gonna be the one
to say "goodbye"</i>

592
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,441
<i>Neither am I</i>

593
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,646
<i>Oh, tonight</i>

594
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,928
Mr. Levinson?
Do I know you?

595
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,085
Luke Collins.

596
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,005
Remember, off 119...

597
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,484
when you decided to
bust open that guard rail?

598
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,041
Oh, you saved my life.

599
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,401
Thank you.

600
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,925
Hi.

601
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,721
Hi.

602
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,401
Is this your Luke?

603
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,282
This is my friend Luke.

604
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,800
Yes.

605
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,930
Your friend. Hmm.

606
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,331
Mmm-hmm.

607
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,526
What are you doing here?

608
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,764
I found this on
the floor of my truck.

609
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,605
Figured you might wanna
hang on to that one.

610
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,441
<i>December 7th, 1941.</i>

611
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,005
<i>Nothing made me happier than knowing
we were going to be married.</i>

612
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,004
<i>But the world you and
your family had fled...</i>

613
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,090
<i>finally caught up to us.</i>

614
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,131
<i>The United States of America...</i>

615
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,409
<i>Was suddenly
and deliberately attacked...</i>

616
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,040
<i>by Naval and Air Forces...</i>

617
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,771
<i>of the Empire of Japan.</i>

618
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,969
Promise me you'll come back.
I will.

619
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,248
Promise me, Ira!

620
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,765
I promise.

621
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,483
Look at me. I promise.

622
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,768
Come back to me!

623
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,245
Help!

624
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,290
We can't just
leave him out there.

625
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,327
Help! Help me!

626
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,126
Somebody help me!

627
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,761
I gotta save him.

628
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,691
Are you crazy?
Those Panzers are 200 yards away.

629
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,880
You'll never make it back.

630
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,802
I'll make it back.
I made a promise
I have to keep.

631
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,243
You getting killed ain't gonna
help anyone but the Germans.

632
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,482
Help me! Please!

633
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,051
Oh, my God!

634
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,767
Can somebody help me?

635
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,487
Oh, shit.

636
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,969
Put your arms around my neck.

637
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,966
I gotta get back.
I gotta get back to Ruth.

638
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,600
That was goddamn crazy,
Levinson.
Do you know that?

639
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,400
Shit!

640
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,643
I'm very sorry.

641
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,843
<i>When I came back from the war,
I wasn't the same.</i>

642
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,451
<i>I was fighting
a bigger battle now.</i>

643
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,207
<i>And I couldn't honor the
promise I had made to you.</i>

644
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,682
Your mother says you've
been home since Monday.

645
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,520
I can't pretend to know
what you've been through...

646
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,409
but I want to help.

647
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,447
Don't you think
I deserve an explanation?

648
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,364
Well...

649
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,090
I do.

650
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,888
You don't understand.
It wasn't the injury itself.

651
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,724
The wound got infected.

652
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,564
I ran a high fever
for almost two weeks.

653
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,121
You need to see more doctors.
Get a second opinion.

654
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,442
Don't you think
I've already done that?

655
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,887
There's nothing
they can do.

656
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,404
This is my life,
I have to accept it.

657
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,481
But I don't want it
to be yours.

658
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,165
But there is still a chance.

659
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,209
I want to marry you.

660
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,283
If you marry me,
you may never have a family.

661
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,001
Are you honestly willing
to give that up?

662
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,290
<i>The war was over...</i>

663
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,004
<i>and as far as I
was concerned...</i>

664
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,171
<i>so was my life.</i>

665
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,760
We're closed!

666
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,045
I know what you're doing!

667
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,248
You cannot tell me
what I'm willing to give up!

668
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,326
When you went to war...

669
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,484
I was here,
clinging to the hope...

670
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,445
that you would come home
and we would get married.

671
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,851
Yes, and have kids.
But that's a dream, Ira.

672
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,284
You're real.

673
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,920
I don't know what
the future holds...

674
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,327
but I know there's
no future without you.

675
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,404
Unless you don't
love me anymore.

676
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,203
<i>And in that moment...</i>

677
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,169
<i>we both knew...</i>

678
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,930
<i>a chance at life together was
greater than the risk of being apart.</i>

679
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,407
It was really nice of you
to bring that photo.

680
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,808
He sure has been
through a lot.

681
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,921
Yeah.

682
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,881
Uh...

683
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,803
Well, you take it easy.

684
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,561
Luke.

685
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,049
It was really good
to see you.

686
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,762
What are you doing
right now?

687
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,366
That looks good.

688
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,567
Yeah.

689
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,404
- I'm ready.
- All right.

690
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,244
I'm so ready.

691
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,600
I'll give you
the little stick.

692
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,801
Thank you.
Yeah.

693
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,810
Ladies first.

694
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,446
I'm still getting used to
your Southern gentlemanly ways.

695
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,523
I'm still trying
to impress you.

696
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,604
It's kind of working.

697
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,444
A little.
Mmm...

698
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,682
Just don't let me win.

699
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,047
I enjoy good,
healthy competition.

700
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,161
Noted.

701
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,760
What are you doing?

702
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,564
You told me not
to let you win.

703
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,921
So I'm going with plan B.
Distraction.

704
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,286
Hmm.

705
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,805
Mmm-hmm.

706
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,721
Yes!

707
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,882
Yes! Sorry!

708
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,720
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

709
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,407
Oh, I love mac and cheese.

710
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,931
Comfort food?

711
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,081
Yeah.

712
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,286
What's your comfort food?

713
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,404
Kolduny.

714
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,561
Kol-what?
Kolduny.

715
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,883
They're these super,
super delicious...

716
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,571
Polish meat dumplings
that my mom makes.

717
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,400
We serve them
at the diner...

718
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,404
and I promise you,
with one bite of those...

719
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,200
it would put your mac
and cheese to shame.

720
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,805
Is that an invitation?

721
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,921
Maybe.

722
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,286
Oh. No, no.
Help yourself.

723
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,401
No!
Yeah.

724
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,084
Just a bite.

725
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,965
When did your parents
come to the States?

726
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,645
Uh, before I was born.

727
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,443
That's crazy.
I couldn't have done that.

728
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,523
Really?
No.

729
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,081
You ride bulls for a living.
You could do anything.

730
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,125
Riding bulls has got nothing
on moving clear across the world.

731
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,606
What?
Yeah.

732
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,683
Your parents had to
adjust their whole life.

733
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,491
No, they didn't
adjust anything.

734
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,840
Growing up with
immigrant parents,

735
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,888
my life was always
really different.

736
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,361
Everyone was always
screaming in weird languages...

737
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,966
I brought smelly,
strange snacks to school.

738
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,964
My pants were
too short always.

739
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,400
Pants still are too short.

740
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,282
Growing up on a cattle ranch,
everybody I knew was the same.

741
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,684
Everybody you know is fourth
generation cattle ranchers.

742
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,048
I'm jealous.
Why?

743
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,680
I wanted to be like everyone
else when I was little.

744
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:26,409
The reason I like you is because
you're nothing like everyone else.

745
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,807
You're not so bad yourself.

746
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,885
I think before I met you,
the closest thing I came
to cattle was...

747
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,960
steak.

748
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,566
Steak? Time to get you
on a bull, then.

749
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,801
A bull?
Yeah.

750
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,081
No way!

751
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,447
One bull, one time.

752
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,171
No! How about one horse,
one time?

753
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,887
We could do that.

754
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,644
Next week.
Okay.

755
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,886
Ooh. I've got an idea.
Uh-oh.

756
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,406
It's so good.
What?

757
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,329
So good! Come on!

758
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,851
What?
Where am I going?

759
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,321
Where are we going?
You'll see.

760
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,568
After you.
Wow. Thank you.

761
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,571
Ready?

762
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,324
Crazy face.
Yeah.

763
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,042
Yeah, that looks good.

764
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,367

you're pretty good

818
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,365
Oh, you make soup, too?

819
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,125
Kind of.

820
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,209
Soup, soup, soup...

821
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,124
Oh, my God.

822
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,281
Come on.

823
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,491
There you go.

824
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,486
Put your hands right here.

825
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,645
The goal's pretty simple.

826
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,600
All you gotta do
is hang on for eight seconds.

827
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,606
Wow!

828
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,250
There's nothing to it.

829
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,641
Yeah, some bulls
are nice like that.

830
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,251
This is...
Yeah, okay.

831
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,970
Excuse us, sorry.

832
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,721
Sorry.

833
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,523
So how do you know
which one you're gonna get?

834
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,841
You don't.

835
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,684
<i>You pick from a bowl.</i>

836
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,606
<i>And the fan favorite from Walkertown,
North Carolina...</i>

837
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,808
<i>Luke Collins!</i>

838
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,850
<i>Number four is the chip
you selected...</i>

839
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,764
<i>and that is Gunpowder
and Lead, Luke.</i>

840
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,689
<i>Jared Middleton reaching in...</i>

841
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,604
<i>and pulling out chip
number two.</i>

842
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,683
<i>You have Asteroid.</i>

843
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,321
Whoa... Whoa!

844
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,603
That's impossible!
Yeah!

845
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,400
You can only touch
with your riding hand.

846
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,005
All other touching's
against the rules.

847
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,969
Okay. I got it.

848
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,841
Let's go!

849
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,085
If you are off balance even a little,
you lose points.

850
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,924
<i>But if you control the bull,
you get style points.</i>

851
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,043
Is that how you do
the hand? That?

852
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,687
More or less.

853
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,445
The bull is judged too,
on speed, agility and power.

854
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,763
<i>Whether it bucks or blows out,
turns back around on you.</i>

855
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,521
Yeah!

856
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,731
Some bulls are just
plain mean.

857
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,121
And others...

858
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,570
<i>Others are monsters.</i>

859
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,969
Let's brave the storm.

860
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,321
Let's do it.

861
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,010
This is certainly better
than the hospital, isn't it?

862
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,320
How are you feeling?

863
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,960
The better question is,
how do I look?

864
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,251
Very handsome.

865
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,010
All I care about.

866
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,250
Hold on one second.

867
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,361
Hello?

868
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,646
<i>Hi, Sophia. This is Adrienne.</i>

869
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,006
Hi, Ms. Francis.

870
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,481
<i>My client has an exhibit
in Charlotte next weekend.</i>

871
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,687
<i>Can you be there?</i>

872
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,330
Yeah, I'd love to.
That sounds great.

873
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,720
<i>This could be
a real opportunity for us.</i>

874
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,800
Okay.

875
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:41,921
<i>I'll email you the details.</i>

876
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,087
Okay. All right,
I'll talk to you soon.

877
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,160
<i>Bye, Sophia.</i>

878
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,201
Thanks, bye.

879
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,647
Good news?

880
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,040
Yeah.

881
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,081
Um...

882
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,600
The woman I'm working for
this summer...

883
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,887
she has a client with an
art exhibit in Charlotte...

884
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,451
and wants me
to help her out.

885
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,529
I didn't know you had
an interest in art.

886
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,166
Only since I was,
like, five.

887
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,721
Ruth also loved art.
Yeah.

888
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,566
Yeah, I remember the story
with the painting in the hotel lobby.

889
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,043
You've heard of
Black Mountain College?

890
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,246
I'm doing my senior
thesis on it right now.

891
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,164
That's where
I was headed...

892
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,527
when I got in that fight
with the guardrail.

893
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,563
Are you sure this is how
you want to spend your honeymoon?

894
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,640
Oh, I promise you're going
to love it, I promise!

895
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,326
I'd rather we'd just
stayed in bed.

896
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:52,242
<i>You weren't able to engage
your passion for contemporary art...</i>

897
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,771
<i>In our little town...</i>

898
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,287
<i>so Black Mountain College
was a godsend.</i>

899
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,762
It's so amazing!

900
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,048
Really look at your
work to understand it.

901
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,965
But I want to be able to
control the accidents...

902
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,043
and not leave them to fate...

903
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,248
or the Lord or chance,
whatever you want to call it.

904
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,250
I teach you to see.

905
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,131
Then even an accident
will have purpose...

906
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,049
and direction.

907
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,723
Oh, I love it!

908
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,968
For over 500 years,
artists have been reproducing...

909
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,088
quite literally what
they see in front of them.

910
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,250
Then Kandinsky came
and broke all the rules,
all of them!

911
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,929
Sorry.

912
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,884
I love it!

913
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,844
I can't believe we met
Josef Albers today.

914
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,682
It's just a bit further.

915
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,450
You all right?

916
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,250
Oh!

917
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,326
You ready?

918
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,527
Yeah.

919
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,966
You like it?

920
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,283
<i>From one happy day
to the next...</i>

921
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,361
You said you
love the house, right?

922
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,001
<i>We began the process
of creating a life together.</i>

923
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,161
Doesn't look like
anyone's home.

924
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,368
No, I don't think
you should go in.

925
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,681
Ira!
What?

926
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,723
Well, let's just
use the key.

927
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,207
No! Oh, my God!

928
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,051
You wonderful person!

929
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,440
Wait, wait, wait.
Come here.

930
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,366
Yeah, there.

931
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,681
No.

932
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,481
There.

933
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,566
There! First thing you see
when you come in!

934
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,563
<i>Life was busy
and happy for us.</i>

935
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,084
<i>I took over my dad's
booming business...</i>

936
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,323
<i>and you found a job
teaching at the local school.</i>

937
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,245
Who understands this, huh?

938
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,561
Oh! Look at this!

939
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,485
You're all on your way
to becoming math geniuses.

940
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,563
Solve the problems
on the board.

941
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,206
If you have any questions,
please ask.

942
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,011
Wow, it sounds like
you made her very happy.

943
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,571
I did.

944
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,443
For a while.

945
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,523
His first cowboy hat.

946
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,170
That is so cute!

947
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,281
Never took it off.

948
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,927
He ate in it.

949
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,286
He slept in it.

950
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,602
He even tried to glue it
to his head so it
wouldn't come off!

951
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:47,886
Mom!

952
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,087
What?

953
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,131
He broke his arm riding
a calf when he was seven.

954
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,250
I found him sneaking into
the barn at night to practice...

955
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,687
hanging on with his
non-cast arm.

956
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,320
Even then, I couldn't get him
to stop riding
when he shouldn't.

957
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,245
Hey. There you go.

958
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,084
Thank you.

959
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,401
Sweet.

960
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,882
That's Luke's dad, Jack.

961
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,485
- He was a great man.
- Mmm-hmm.

962
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,290
Great rider, too.

963
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,888
Even if you stop now,
you'd still have a
better career than he had.

964
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,286
What happened?

965
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,564
He died of a heart attack.

966
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,609
Yeah, almost five years
ago now.

967
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,921
How about a little dessert?

968
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,731
Luke, wait till you see
what I made for you.

969
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,446
Sophia, it's worth
the calories.

970
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,281
No.

971
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,881
How come your mom keeps
talking about you giving up riding?

972
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,530
She's just being
an overprotective mom.

973
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,684
How bad did you get hurt?

974
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:05,841
Sophia...
No.

975
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,809
I know all riders
are bound to get hurt.

976
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,803
It's not a matter of
"if" but "when."

977
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,007
That's right.

978
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,240
They say all bull riders
are either stupid or crazy.

979
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,124
Yeah, and which one
are you?

980
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,530
I don't know.
I guess a little of both.

981
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,406
What are you doing?

982
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,406
This is a new painting by an
artist that Adrienne Francis represents.

983
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,042
You know, the woman
I'm interning for?

984
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,043
$80 grand, really?

985
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,600
A lot of people
think he's a genius.

986
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,729
Yeah,
he most certainly is...

987
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,009
getting people to fork
over $80 grand for that.

988
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:46,040
Are you sure that you wanna
go to this gallery showing in Charlotte?

989
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,770
You want me to, right?

990
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:48,841
Of course.

991
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,571
Then I'll be there.

992
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,609
Yeah, but you're riding
that afternoon.

993
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,410
I'll be there.

994
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,446
Wow! Don't you
look nice!

995
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,641
Never seen you in a
coat and tie before.

996
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,371
Yeah, doesn't happen
too often.

997
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,449
Oh, that's my boss,
Adrienne Francis.

998
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,601
I gotta go. Okay?

999
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,569
Yeah. Go.

1000
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,600
Hi. Sophia.
Nice to meet you.

1001
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,160
Hopefully, Sophia will be
joining me in New York,
and my team.

1002
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,723
You usually find these sort of things
in process art or lenticular prints...

1003
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,451
but it's very rare
in brushwork.

1004
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,327
That is what makes
this piece so special.

1005
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,802
If you have any questions,
let me know. Thank you.

1006
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,040
Excuse me.

1007
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,201
Just one second.

1008
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,760
It'll be worth
twice that a year from now.

1009
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,962
At $20,000, it's a steal.

1010
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,605
- Sure.
- Good.

1011
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,807
Do you wanna get it?

1012
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,490
Let's do it.
Okay.

1013
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,485
I'll fly you to New York.
See the space, meet the team.

1014
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,561
Yes!

1015
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,120
These are some
very important people.

1016
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,561
So if you can't do it,
don't say yes.
No...

1017
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,480
I know you have finals
and other commitments.

1018
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,729
I'd love to.
This is the most important
thing to me.

1019
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,681
Oh! Uh, Luke, hi.

1020
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,888
This is Adrienne Francis.

1021
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,849
Adrienne, this is
my boyfriend, Luke.

1022
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,080
Nice to meet you,
Ms. Francis.
Nice to meet you, Luke.

1023
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,004
Are you in college
with Sophia?

1024
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,645
No, never made it
to college.

1025
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,847
Luke's a professional
bull rider.

1026
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,526
I've never met a professional
bull rider before.

1027
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,682
Probably not too many
in Manhattan.

1028
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,366
Are you an art lover,
like Sophia?

1029
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,204
No, I can't say that I am.

1030
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,250
What did you think
of tonight?

1031
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,321
Honestly?

1032
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,406
Of course.

1033
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,280
I think there's more bullshit
here than where I work.

1034
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,401
I like him. Keep this one.

1035
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,888
How could you
say that to her?

1036
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,045
It was a joke.

1037
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,407
To the woman
who's gonna be my boss?

1038
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,528
To the woman who I hope
is gonna launch my career?

1039
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,603
That lady? Come on.
No, you come on.

1040
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,089
You know how hard I have
just tried to fit into your world.

1041
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,600
Why can't you try to
fit into mine?

1042
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,921
I do!

1043
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,562
It was a joke, okay?
She thought it was funny.

1044
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:04,245
She laughed.
You don't know that.

1045
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,209
What if she was just trying
to be polite?

1046
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,610
Does this make sense?

1047
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,081
What?

1048
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,810
How are we gonna
make this work, huh?

1049
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,160
Do you really see yourself
living on a ranch?

1050
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,884
Working a ranch
the rest of your life?

1051
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,963
And what am I gonna do?

1052
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,603
Move to Manhattan?

1053
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,560
Go out with your artist friends?
Go to brunch?

1054
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,130
Talk about squiggly lines
on a white canvas...

1055
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,770
like they're more than squiggly
lineson a white canvas?

1056
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,969
I know all of that,
I do. I get it.

1057
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,641
I just...

1058
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,807
I just don't know
how to make this work.

1059
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,128
I don't know either.

1060
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,082
But I know that I want to.

1061
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,003
Are we just crazy?

1062
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,691
Do you think it could
work between us?

1063
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,643
We just come from
such different worlds.

1064
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:31,004
But I've never felt this way
about anybody before.

1065
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,529
Not everybody gets that.

1066
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,045
You did.

1067
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,321
It wasn't that simple.

1068
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,845
<i>As the years went by...</i>

1069
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,527
<i>I could see how much
she wanted to start a family.</i>

1070
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,842
<i>We tried to adopt.</i>

1071
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,520
<i>But it wasn't so easy
back then.</i>

1072
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,246
Now, today we're
going to learn...

1073
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,800
about my favorite...

1074
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,291
book.

1075
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,886
<i>It's called Pippi Longstocking.</i>

1076
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,929
If anyone
teases him about this,

1077
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,889
they'll have me to deal with.

1078
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,724
Good morning.

1079
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,811
Hello.

1080
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,282
My name is Ruth Levinson.
I'm Daniel's teacher.

1081
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,446
I came here because
I'm slightly concerned.

1082
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:30,971
He's falling asleep in class.

1083
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,690
<i>We were
surprised to learn...</i>

1084
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:37,448
<i>that Daniel McDonald was being
raised by a half-brother and his wife.</i>

1085
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,921
<i>Neither seemed to care
if he ate or starved.</i>

1086
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,084
He's a very bright boy.

1087
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,327
Infinite potential.

1088
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,809
Maybe I could tutor him
after class?

1089
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:48,927
All right.

1090
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:50,966
Yes?

1091
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,210
Are you a wolf?

1092
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,401
No, ma'am.

1093
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,285
Are you a bear?

1094
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,361
No, ma'am.

1095
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,121
Oh.

1096
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,528
Are you a boy?

1097
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,211
Yes, ma'am.

1098
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,884
Boys use knives and forks.

1099
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,891
Oh. Almost.

1100
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,880
Yeah. Okay.

1101
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,884
What star is that?

1102
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,883
The North Star, Polaris.

1103
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,764
Good. Look.

1104
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,811
"That was because
she didn't want to

1105
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,251
"turn around to get home.

1106
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:27,086
"When she reached
Tommy's and Annika's gate,
she stopped.

1107
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,444
<i>Pretty soon,
the tutoring was every day.</i>

1108
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:36,085
<i>And sometimes he
stayed for dinner.</i>

1109
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,489
<i>We never said he was the child
we could never have...</i>

1110
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,843
<i>but even so...</i>

1111
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,530
What do you think?

1112
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,843
She's making her son dinner.
Right?

1113
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,561
Yeah.

1114
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,964
I hate taking him back there.
Why can't we adopt him?

1115
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,121
Because they're his
legal guardians.

1116
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,240
There's nothing we can do.

1117
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,281
Did you speak
to the lawyer?

1118
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,089
I did, and
that's what he said.

1119
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:28,006
They don't care about him.
They don't!

1120
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,685
They're his next of kin
and they're proud people.

1121
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,080
They're not gonna let us
take Daniel away.

1122
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,328
There must be
something more we can do.

1123
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:42,681
Ruth?

1124
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,126
We better go.

1125
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,925
You be good.
Okay, pal?

1126
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,206
Okay.

1127
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,087
Maybe I'll raise chickens...

1128
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,765
or work at the factory.

1129
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,524
If that's what you want.

1130
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,041
You can be anything you want,
Daniel McDonald.

1131
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:46,167
Anything at all.
A farmer, a lawyer,
an astronomer.

1132
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,960
You're a very clever boy.

1133
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,609
You really think so?
Yeah!

1134
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,331
I know so.

1135
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,890
All right, come on.

1136
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,681
Okay.

1137
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,046
I'm just saying goodbye.

1138
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,127
You can't stop me!

1139
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,123
I'm just saying goodbye!

1140
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,360
I know you are, sweetheart.
Let's go back to the car.

1141
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,800
There's nothing we can do.
There's nothing we can do.

1142
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,803
Please reconsider.
Please reconsider!

1143
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,000
There's nothing we can do.

1144
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,565
He deserves
better than this.

1145
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,731
Sweetheart,
get in the car.

1146
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,405
They don't care about him.
I know they don't.

1147
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,602
They don't care about him!

1148
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,487
Ruth.

1149
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,281
Ruth.

1150
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,525
What was I supposed to do?

1151
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,365
Fight for custody.

1152
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,444
From a half-brother
in small-town North Carolina?

1153
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,202
Come on. We wouldn't have
had a chance!

1154
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,807
And who knows what they
would've done to Daniel.

1155
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,803
We were a family.

1156
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,402
We are a family.

1157
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,246
Ruth, you are my family.

1158
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,404
I wanted kids too, you know.

1159
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,411
We never saw Daniel again.

1160
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,410
Oh, my God.

1161
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,401
Oh, shit.

1162
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,562
<i>Luke Collins
is trying to come around.</i>

1163
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,925
<i>The bull fighter's taking the
bull away in the other direction.</i>

1164
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,244
<i>I think he's gonna be okay.
He's trying to get up. He is!</i>

1165
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,165
<i>Let me get him something to make
him feel a little bit better.</i>

1166
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,971
<i>92 points!</i>

1167
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,610
<i>264 on three bulls!</i>

1168

<i>Luke Collins is
your clear-cut winner.</i>

1169
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,487
He's awesome.

1170
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,723
<i>...number nine spot
in the world.</i>

1171
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,450
Are you okay, Luke?

1172
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,449
I'm fine.

1173
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:45,881
All right.

1174
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,486
Have an amazing time in New York.
Yes, I will.

1175
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,530
You impressed Adrienne,
you'll impress her team.

1176
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,687
Okay. Gotta go.

1177
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,290
This is what you've always wanted!
I know!

1178
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,965
Bye! See you on Monday.

1179
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,489
Hey, babe.
I'm walking to the taxi right now.

1180
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,483
<i>Sophia, it's Luiz.</i>

1181
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,369
Hi, Luiz.
<i>Something's happened to Luke.</i>

1182
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:09,841
Hi, can I help you?

1183
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,162
Um, I need to see
my boyfriend, Luke Collins.

1184
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,607
He came in an ambulance earlier.
I need to see him.

1185
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,001
I'm sorry.
Only family can visit.

1186
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,009
Okay. Can I at least know
how he is?

1187
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,123
His condition is stable,
but he's getting an MRI.

1188
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,280
He took a pretty hard fall.

1189
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,689
If you wanna take a seat,
I'll check with the doctor.

1190
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,330
I'll let you know.

1191
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,166
Thank you.

1192
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,490
So, are you light-headed,
dizzy?

1193
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,850
Nausea?

1194
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,689
I'd like you to stay
overnight for observation.

1195
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,964
Sweetie. What are you
doing here?

1196
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,045
I came as soon as I heard.

1197
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,041
Aren't you supposed to
be in New York?

1198
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,805
No, no.

1199
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,361
I should be here.

1200
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,370
Thank God you're okay.

1201
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:07,520
I'm fine.

1202
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,528
You're lucky to be alive,
is what you are.

1203
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,521
What?

1204
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,210
I just got a little dizzy,
that's all.

1205
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,481
Luke,

1206
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,046
you need to stop downplaying
the severity of your condition.

1207
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:21,409
If you care about your friend,
you need to make him understand...

1208
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,846
that his riding days
are over.

1209
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,767
What is he talking about?

1210
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,250
I'm tired, okay?

1211
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,562
Can we just talk
about it tomorrow?

1212
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:44,004
Ms. Francis,
I am so sorry about all of this.

1213
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,081
<i>Please, Sophia.</i>

1214
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:48,482
<i>I understand you can't meet
the team this weekend,
given the circumstances.</i>

1215
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,244
<i>And I do hope Luke is okay.</i>

1216
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,368
Yeah, me, too.

1217
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,611
I don't know when
I'm gonna be able to come to New York.

1218
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,762
<i>Oh, really?</i>

1219
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:04,084
<i>Wait a minute.
You're not rethinking
the internship, are you?</i>

1220
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,931
<i>Look, Sophia.</i>

1221
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,764
<i>I think you have a bright
future ahead of you...</i>

1222
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:12,083
<i>but you're going to have to figure
out for yourself what that's going to be.</i>

1223
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,884
I know.

1224
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:30,609
<i>World Finals

1226
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,450

1227
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,601

1229

1232
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,045
<i>Yeah,
no doubt about it.</i>

1233
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,600

No. It's fine, please.
Thanks.

1243
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,485
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1244
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:42,841
I'll take the bag.

1245
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,371
No, I got it.

1246
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,407
Thank you.

1247
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,050
Luke...

1248
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,370
I'm really sorry.

1249
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:25,802
I know how hard it must be to
give up that whole part of your life.

1250
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:31,880
You're kidding, right?

1251
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,001
Sophia...

1252
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,923
You heard the doctors.

1253
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,366
Doctors don't know
everything.

1254
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,567
Are you crazy?

1255
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,250
I watched what happened
to you on YouTube.

1256
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,050
You were in a coma
for 10 days.

1257
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,851
I told you, every time
a rider gets in that chute,
he could die.

1258
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,606
That's bullshit!
Your situation is different!

1259
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,084
You have to quit!

1260
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,322
You have to!
I can't!

1261
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,960
I can't be with someone if every
time they walk out the door...

1262
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,445
I don't know if I'm gonna
see them again!

1263
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,561
Then that's your choice.

1264
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,643
Yeah, I chose you!
I chose you over New York!

1265
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,811
Over my internship.
I chose you over everything.

1266
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,240
I didn't ask you
to change your life.

1267
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,323
You can't expect me
to change mine.

1268
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,122
This is what I do.

1269
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,962
It's all I know.

1270
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,844
This is my life.

1271
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,526
I thought this was
our life.

1272
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,248
I can't watch you ruin it.

1273
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,407
Hi.

1274
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,608
Right upstairs.
Thanks.

1275
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,731
How was...

1276
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,363
How was New York?

1277
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:12,606
I never made it.

1278
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,571
And I broke up
with Luke anyway.

1279
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,366
I'm really sorry.
Come here.

1280
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,806
Come here.

1281
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,764
How can I help?

1282
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,847
Take my mind off of it.

1283
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,566
What happened
after that fight over Daniel?

1284
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,730
Are you sure you don't wanna
talk about you and Luke?

1285
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,881
Mmm.

1286
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,769
Yeah, I'm sure.

1287
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,043
It's a scary thing.

1288
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,330
How the people
you're closest to...

1289
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,287
can so quickly become...

1290
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,644
strangers.

1291
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:36,090
I can't do this anymore.

1292
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:42,206
I'm going crazy.

1293
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,966
I know it's not your fault.

1294
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:53,290
I have to go.

1295
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,642
No, please don't!
I just need to say something.

1296
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:41,930
I need to say something.

1297
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,410
I fell in love with you
the first time I saw you.

1298
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,688
You're just the most amazing,
beautiful girl I ever met...

1299
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:53,921
and somehow...

1300
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,731
I don't know,
somehow you chose me.

1301
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,927
But howl loved you then...

1302
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,560
it's nothing compared to
how I love you now.

1303
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,850
Now, I love you with
everything inside of me.

1304
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,324
I think you should go.

1305
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:19,248
I love you so much,
I just want you to be happy.

1306
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,930
Even if that happiness
no longer includes me.

1307
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,490
Love requires sacrifice.

1308
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:12,531
Always.

1309
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:19,210
<i>And from that day on,
Sophia,</i>

1310
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,801
<i>it wasn't exactly happily ever after,
but it was pretty close.</i>

1311
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:29,166
<i>We focused on celebrating all the
wonderful things we had...</i>

1312
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,000
<i>rather than regretting
the things we didn't.</i>

1313
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,767
<i>Every anniversary,
we would drive to Black Mountain.</i>

1314
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:39,765
<i>I still wrote Ruth letters...</i>

1315
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,002
<i>even though I saw her
every day.</i>

1316
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,885
Ruthie.

1317
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,201
Ruth.

1318
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,884
<i>So many wonderful years.</i>

1319
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:31,206
<i>But, of course,
not nearly enough.</i>

1320
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,321
<i>The paintings
Ruth and I had collected...</i>

1321
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:51,601
<i>only served as a reminder
of what I had lost.</i>

1322
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:55,361
<i>So I packed them away.</i>

1323
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,285
Can I help you?

1324
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:00,930
My name is
Andrea McDonald.

1325
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,642
I believe you knew
my husband...

1326
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:06,404
Daniel McDonald?

1327
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:13,687
He collapsed in his classroom
early one morning before school.

1328
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,161
A brain aneurysm.

1329
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:18,761
That was six years ago.

1330
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,841
I'm very sorry to hear that.

1331
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,331
Thank you.

1332
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,007
He was a teacher?

1333
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,489
A professor.

1334
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,371
Physics and astronomy
at the University College London.

1335
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,330
Astronomy.

1336
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:38,609
I moved back to the States
a few years ago.

1337
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:41,608
When I saw your wife's
obituary in the paper...

1338
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,290
I knew I had to
bring you this.

1339
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,130
It meant a lot to him.

1340
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,370
You did everything you could
with Luke, Sophia.

1341
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,164
You sacrificed.

1342
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,242
I have loved
spending time with you.

1343
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,048
You've made me very happy.

1344
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:27,247
What are you doing up
so late?

1345
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,410
I won tonight.

1346
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,724
Puts me fifth in the world.

1347
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,640
Are you really gonna
start on me now?

1348
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,601
No.

1349
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,244
The mistakes you make
are your own.

1350
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,568
Mistake? Jesus, Mom!

1351
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,809
These risks you're taking...

1352
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,200
I don't know why.

1353
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,761
I'm just trying to keep
this ranch in the family.

1354
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:55,887
For you.

1355
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:00,966
For me?

1356
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:02,127
Yeah.

1357
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,611
This isn't about me.

1358
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,971
Where are you gonna live?

1359
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:07,929
If we don't have this place,
where are you gonna go?

1360
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:11,243
Do you honestly think
I give a damn?

1361
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,767
You're doing this
for yourself.

1362
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,964
It's eight seconds.

1363
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,649
That's all it is.

1364
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,771
That girl could be
the rest of your life.

1365
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,126
<i>Sophia Danko?</i>

1366
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,169
Uh, yes. This is she.

1367
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:13,530
<i>My name is Howie Sanders.
I'm the attorney for Ira Levinson.</i>

1368
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,688
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

1369
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,202
Uh, yeah. What is it?
Is he okay?

1370
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,889
<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Danko.</i>

1371
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,002
<i>He passed away
late last night.</i>

1372
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:31,725
<i>Ms. Danko?</i>

1373
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,404
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1374
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,721
Yeah.

1375
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:40,523
<i>Mr. Levinson's art collection is
being auctioned off next week.</i>

1376
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,684
<i>This is a private auction,
and is by invitation only.</i>

1377
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:46,531
<i>And Ira asked
if you would attend.</i>

1378
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,521
Yeah, of course.

1379
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,367
<i>I know this is short notice.</i>

1380
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:55,048
<i>But it's important to know...</i>

1381
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,322
<i>he was very fond of you.</i>

1382
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,762
I was very fond of him, too.

1383
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,401
<i>Well, I'll send
all the information along.</i>

1384
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,047
<i>It was nice
to finally talk with you.</i>

1385
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:15,601
Thank you.

1386
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:29,964
<i>Tonight we're gonna be watching
the top bull riders in the world.</i>

1387
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,041
Aces.

1388
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:46,170
<i>This is the one and only PBR!</i>

1389
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:55,526
<i>Time to meet
your top 15 contenders!</i>

1390
01:46:56,320 --> 01:47:00,848
<i>Being led out by the
number-one-ranked
bull rider in the world...</i>

1391
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,844
<i>from Oklahoma,
Jared Middleton!</i>

1392
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,526
<i>Boy, what a fight
it has been...</i>

1393
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:10,366
<i>between him and the man
from North Carolina...</i>

1394
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:12,170
<i>Luke Collins!</i>

1395
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:15,364
<i>It has been an epic battle
between those two...</i>

1396
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,727
<i>for this title!</i>

1397
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:21,851
<i>But don't count out men
atop that leaderboard!</i>

1398
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,207
<i>We will now go
atop the shark cage...</i>

1399
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:27,523
<i>for our
championship-round draft.</i>

1400
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:31,082
<i>Ryan Dirteater,
you will have Smackdown.
We will see you soon.</i>

1401
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:34,687
<i>Now over to Billy Robinson,
the talent from Virginia.</i>

1402
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:37,281
<i>Billy, let's find out
what bull you will face.</i>

1403
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:41,729
<i>You are going to face
Bushwacker! Congratulations!</i>

1404
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:45,362
<i>Now to the fan favorite
from North Carolina,
Luke Collins!</i>

1405
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:48,040
<i>Luke, your fate
is in that cup.</i>

1406
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:50,771
<i>It is time for you to reach in
and pull out your bull...</i>

1407
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:52,729
<i>for this championship round.</i>

1408
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,484
<i>Let's see what it will be.</i>

1409
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:58,486
<i>Luke, you will have
the number-one contender...</i>

1410
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:01,041
<i>for this year's
World Champion Bucking Bull...</i>

1411
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:02,161
<i>Rango!</i>

1412
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:26,125
<i>Okay, Nashville.</i>

1413
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,248
<i>You know
who I'm talking about.</i>

1414
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:31,244
<i>With 99
consecutive buck-offs...</i>

1415
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,761
<i>and staring down number 100...</i>

1416
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,003
<i>this is the number-one-ranked
bucking bull in the world!</i>

1417
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:46,211
<i>He is doing one of the most
difficult things in sports...</i>

1418
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:48,806
<i>and that is
mounting a comeback.</i>

1419
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,210
<i>Yeah, but Luke Collins,
he is on PBR fire!</i>

1420
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,361
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1421
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:58,844
You got it! Keep riding!

1422
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:22,967
Yeah! Yeah!

1423
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:06,284
<i>We have just seen
David slay Goliath!</i>

1424
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,521
Hey, Luke, you made
the eight on Rango.

1425
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:58,125
I knew you were a cowboy.

1426
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,889
One hell of a ride,
son, I tell you!

1427
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,008
Luke, we gotta get together
now and talk some business.

1428
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:05,128
Luke?
Luke, where you going?

1429
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,163
The Levinson artwork
is the largest

1430
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,163
and most valuable
private collection.

1431
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:15,164
Not only are these pieces sourced
from local Black Mountain College...

1432
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:17,004
but the world.

1433
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:18,685
We'll look at contemporary
modern artists...

1434
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:21,684
such as Andy Warhol,
Pat Passlof,
and Willem de Kooning.

1435
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:24,089
These are
amazing works of art...

1436
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,368
and incredibly diverse,
as you already know.

1437
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:29,171
Never been seen in one place
like this before.

1438
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:30,765
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen

1439
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:33,286
for attending this
remarkable auction.

1440
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,807
If everyone could
take their seats, please.

1441
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:39,009
I know we are all eager
to get started.

1442
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:43,891
Before we begin,
a personal note.

1443
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:50,131
Welcome. I'm Howard Sanders.

1444
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,448
I was Ruth and Ira
Levinson's attorney...

1445
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,489
for more than 25 years.

1446
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:57,883
Now, Ira's will
is very detailed...

1447
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:00,010
on how he wants to
proceed today.

1448
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:03,524
So, let me start by reading
you a letter he wrote...

1449
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:05,600
specifically for the occasion.

1450
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,202
"My name is Ira Levinson.

1451
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:13,843
"I'm an ordinary man who fell in
love with an extraordinary woman.

1452
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,642
"Around this room you will see some
beautiful and priceless works of art.

1453
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:22,486
"Ruth had an incredible eye
for talent...

1454
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:25,086
"while I only had
eyes for her.

1455
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:27,721
"For me...

1456
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:31,680
"the great joy of collecting
wasn't in the art itself..."

1457
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:34,047
<i>...but in the person
I collected it with.</i>

1458
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:36,290
<i>My beloved Ruth.</i>

1459
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:40,169
<i>The happiness these paintings
brought her was immeasurable.</i>

1460
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,531
<i>And sharing that happiness...</i>

1461
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,249
<i>was the great privilege
of my life.</i>

1462
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,682
<i>We celebrated, we achieved.</i>

1463
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:51,724
<i>We endured, we compromised.</i>

1464
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:53,201
<i>And above all...</i>

1465
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,291
<i>we loved.</i>

1466
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:57,725
<i>The true work of art...</i>

1467
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:00,406
<i>was the longest ride
Ruth and I shared.</i>

1468
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:02,843
<i>This thing called life.</i>

1469
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:08,045
<i>There's not a painting here
I wouldn't trade in a heartbeat...</i>

1470
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:10,043
<i>to hear her voice.</i>

1471
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,443
<i>Or see her smile.</i>

1472
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:16,969
<i>Just one more time.</i>

1473
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:18,525
Signed, Ira Levinson.

1474
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,568
Thank you all for coming.

1475
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:31,322
Thank you, Mr. Sanders.

1476
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:38,041
First up, a painting located
on page 34 of your catalogues...

1477
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,487
titled <i>Portrait of Ruth.</i>

1478
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:49,563
Composed by American Daniel McDonald,
born 1954, died 2001.

1479
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:52,644
The work is circa 1963.

1480
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:56,011
We'll start the bidding at $1,000 for
<i>Portrait of Ruth.</i>

1481
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,646
Do I hear $1,000?

1482
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,804
Who has $1,000 for me?

1483
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:04,851
How about $800?
Who can give me $800?

1484
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,130
Just $800, folks.

1485
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:11,291
$600.

1486
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:14,009
Do I hear $600?

1487
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:19,690
Who has $600 for <i>Portrait of Ruth,</i>
the first work of the evening?

1488
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:21,201
$600.

1489
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:24,720
I have $600.
I have $600, here.

1490
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,644
Going once.

1491
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:29,929
I have $600. Going twice.

1492
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:32,441
Fair warning.

1493
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:35,648
Sold to the young man
right there for $600.

1494
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:46,251
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to take a short pause.

1495
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:49,051
We can take this time
to look at the next item...

1496
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:50,645
which will be a
Jackson Pollock.

1497
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:53,485
That's located on page 124.

1498
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:07,041
There we go.

1499
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:08,804
What are you doing here?

1500
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,883
Ira invited me.

1501
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,204
I'm done bull riding, Sophia.

1502
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,803
I'm done.

1503
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:29,200
Look, I drew Rango
this afternoon.

1504
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:33,286
I thought if I could just
ride that son of a bitch...

1505
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,727
if I could just
make the eight...

1506
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,649
I'd have everything
I ever wanted.

1507
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:41,161
Well, I did. I rode him.

1508
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:44,325
So, you're the best.

1509
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,762
No. Not even close.

1510
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,971
You see, the whole time
I was thinking about you.

1511
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:56,727
I realized that what I want is
standing right in front of me.

1512
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:18,047
What made you buy
that painting?

1513
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:20,601
Ira.

1514
01:57:25,480 --> 01:57:27,721
Excuse me, sir.
We need you in the other room.

1515
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:30,369
Sir?
Not now.

1516
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,760
- Sir?
- Not now.

1517
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,160
Mr. Sanders needs you.

1518
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,601
Quiet! Quiet, please!

1519
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,843
What is your name, son?

1520
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:49,051
Luke Collins.

1521
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:51,521
And did you just close your
purchase of <i>Portrait of Ruth?</i>

1522
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:53,960
Yes.

1523
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:56,122
Mr. Collins,
I have a stipulation...

1524
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:59,409
in Ira Levinson's will
I need to read to you.

1525
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:03,690
<i>"Portrait of Ruth</i> may not be the most
valuable painting in my collection...

1526
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:05,569
"but it was the most
precious to me...

1527
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:08,684
"because it reminded me daily
of my beloved Ruth.

1528
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:11,286
"And so, the terms
of my will are simple.

1529
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:13,323
"Whoever purchases
the portrait...

1530
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:16,326
"will receive the collection
in its entirety."

1531
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:21,363
Ladies and gentlemen,
this auction is over.

1532
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:22,646
What?

1533
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:26,043
This is worth millions.
Millions of dollars.

1534
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:27,680
How much do you want
for the Warhols?

1535
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:29,131
What are your plans
for the Jackson Pollocks?

1536
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:31,600
I have a client who wants to
buy both of the Picassos.

1537
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:34,929
I'll write you a check.

1538
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:39,685
Sorry.

1539
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:43,489
I'm gonna guess that your
head is spinning right about now.

1540
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:45,802
Yeah. That's a good guess.

1541
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:49,124
When your feet
hit the ground, call me.

1542
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,965
You are now
a very wealthy man.

1543
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:15,204
<i>You think you know all about
it then it seems you are wrong</i>

1544
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:22,404
<i>She hit it out of the park
before it had even begun</i>

1545
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:30,606
<i>I needed sunshine in the
darkness burning now</i>

1546
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:38,682
<i>Well, now I know that I'm
the fuel and she's the spark</i>

1547
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:43,527
<i>We are bound to
each other's hearts</i>

1548
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:47,286
<i>Cold, torn and pulled apart</i>

1549
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:48,641
Hey.

1550
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:51,841
Hi.

1551
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:57,369
How was the museum?

1552
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,124
Great.

1553
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:01,682
How was the ranch?

1554
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:02,961
Great.

1555
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:09,609
<i>Like wildfire</i>

1556
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:20,964
<i>These feelings arrange
deep down inside</i>

1557
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:27,930
<i>Try describing a love
you can't design</i>

1558
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:35,847
<i>More and more every
inch of me is holding on</i>

1559
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:43,371
<i>This is it All the flames
are burning strong</i>

1560
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:46,481
"Dearest Ruth..."

1561
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:50,929
<i>When a North Carolina boy meets
a beautiful girl from far away..</i>

1562
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:54,846
<i>He should do everything he can
to win her over.</i>

1563
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,526
<i>And if he does...</i>

1564
02:00:57,680 --> 02:01:00,001
<i>his life will be
a portrait of happiness.</i>

1565

<i>You think you know all about it
then it seems you are wrong</i>

1566
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,845
What?
Come on!

1567
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:16,601
Where are you going?

1568
